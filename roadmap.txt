Basic notes on "what's to be done"


Functionality:
Constructor with sound source and settings object
Set of webaudio nodes to split sound into N channels and merge back
Webaudio capabilities detection (future proof browser support, no browser sniffing)

GUI:
Simple vertical slider control for setting values
Overlay control with the whole equalizer
Themability [by css?]

Architecture:

eqEngine - splits sound to channels and allows changing settings on them
 '- nSplitter - does the splitting to n channels by frequency, allows access to each channel
 '- chan - an abstraction over a single channel - wraps the channel and has methods for manipulation (volume for starters)

ui - shows a control for setting volume of channels
 '- panel - aggregates the sliders
